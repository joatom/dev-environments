# dev-environments
Dockerfiles to set up development environments.

## Purpose
When I try out new techniques I always reach a point after some time when my dev environment is screwed up. This repo will help me to keep track of the installation steps and make me reset a formerly running dev environment quickly.

I use this repo for private purpose only. So if you use it too, do it on your own risk and be aware that the scripts may contain security issues (e.g. absence of proper user setup and root usage).

## Environments
- **ds:fastai**: 
    - Language: python
    - Libraries: fastai, pytorch, torchvision, torchaudio
    - IDE: Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab
